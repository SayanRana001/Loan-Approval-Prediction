ðŸ“Š Loan Approval Prediction using ML
A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details. This project leverages supervised learning techniques for binary classification and includes preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment-ready components.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build an accurate and efficient machine learning model that can predict loan approval outcomes. The system uses a variety of features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more to make predictions.
